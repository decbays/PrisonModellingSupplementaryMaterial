# Prison modelling - supplementary material
----

This repository contains the code used for the modelling work as presented in the paper "Insights gained from early modelling of COVID-19 to inform the management of outbreaks in UK prisons", which has been submitted to the International Journal of Prisoner Health.

In particular, we this repository contains two notebooks - one of which contains our outbreak models (deterministic and stochastic), and the other which contains our reverse cohorting model. These notebooks were also used to produce all figures as used in the above listed paper.
